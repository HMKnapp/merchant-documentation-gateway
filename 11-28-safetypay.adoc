_SafetyPay_ is an asynchronous payment method where the end consumers
finish the payment in their own online-banking account after being
redirected to a _SafetyPay_ landing page during checkout to choose the
currency and the desired bank. There is also the option of a cash
payment, in which case _SafetyPay_ provides a Payment Code for the
consumers that they can use later at any point of collection to pay
(merchant receives a notification confirming the outcome of the
transaction). By integrating _SafetyPay_, merchants can accommodate
consumers who:
--

- prefer not to use a credit card (or do not have one),
- do not want to disclose personal information for fear of fraud,
- wish to shop outside their country but don't have internationally
accepted cards.

Another benefit of _SafetyPay_ is that it significantly reduces
fraudulent purchases, opportunities for identity theft and many other
related security risks by using _push payments_. Consumers submit
("push") their payment to the merchant directly, without providing their
personal & financial information to the merchant or _SafetyPay_. And
since there is no fraud, the merchant controls when and how to refund
consumers: there are no chargebacks or other hidden costs.

_SafetyPay_ is offered as a processing payment model, which means that
the acquirer directly acquires the merchants.
