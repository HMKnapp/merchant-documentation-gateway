*Seamless Mode Advantages*

* Payment form integrated into the checkout page (iframe)
* No consumer redirection, overlays, or pop-ups
* Customization with link:Payment-Page-Designer_3704311.html[Payment
Page Designer]
* PCI DSS SAQ A

Use Seamless Mode to display the WPP payment form as a fully integrated
part of your checkout page. Without redirects to external pages (except
for credit card 3-D Secure verification), overlays, or pop-ups, the
payment form appears native to your website but is still being hosted by
Wirecard.

Use the link:Payment-Page-Designer_3704311.html[Payment Page
Designer] to customize the payment form: set colors, fonts, logos and
more for a cohesive look that meets your preferences and fits your
merchant branding. +

Wirecard hosts all sensitive data - you only need to meet the
requirements of SAQ A to be fully PCI DSS compliant. With Seamless Mode
you can focus on your business and stop worrying about data security.

 

*Currently, Seamless Mode is only available for credit card payments.*
