[#WPP_Features_AdditionalFields]

==== Additional Fields
Billing & shipping fields are not showing in the payment form by
default. However, you may enable these fields to show in the payment form:

* Email 
* Phone 
* Address 1 
* Address 2 
* City 
* State 
* Country 
* Postal Code

NOTE: These fields are available for credit card transactions only.

To show these fields in the form, you have two options:

===== Field Toggles in Payment Page Designer

Click the button(s) of the field you want to show in the Designer menu,
then save the theme. WPP then shows the saved field selection each time
it loads a payment page with that theme.

[#WPP_Features_AdditionalFields_CustomCSSFeature]
===== Using the Custom CSS Feature in Payment Page Designer

image::images/03-01-06-03-additional-fields/AdditionalFields_demoshop_orderOverview.png[Payment Page Designer, float="right", width=500]

Add the CSS class of the field you want to show to the *Payment Page Designer Custom
CSS Editor* and set its `display` property to `block`.

For example:

[source, CSS, syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
.pp-cc-address1 {
    display: block;
 }

 .pp-cc-city {
    display: block;
 }
----

Since the default value of `display` property for these fields
is `none`, as soon as you change it to `block` they become visible.
These CSS settings are a part of the theme and are loaded at any time
that you use that particular theme.

Here is a list of the CSS element names for the hidden fields:

[source, CSS, syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
.pp-cc-email
.pp-cc-phone
.pp-cc-address1
.pp-cc-address2
.pp-cc-city
.pp-cc-state
.pp-cc-country
.pp-cc-postal-code
----
