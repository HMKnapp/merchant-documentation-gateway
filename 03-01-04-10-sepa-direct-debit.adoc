===== SEPA Direct Debit with WPP

This is a reference page for _SEPA Direct Debit_. Here you find all the information
necessary for integrating this payment method into your Hosted and Embedded Payment Page.

.Are you unfamiliar with Wirecard Payment Page (WPP)?

NOTE: Visit one of the integration guides
(<<PPSolutions_WPP_HPP_HPPintegration, Hosted>>,
<<PPSolutions_WPP_HPP_EPPintegration, Embedded>>) for a quick explanation and
a step-by-step guide before continuing.

All <<PPSolutions_WPP, WPP>> integrations share a
<<PPSolutions_WPP_Workflow, common process flow>>﻿ for creating payments.

Below, you find example requests for all available transaction types, 
including field lists with short descriptions.

These requests are designed for the testing environment and do not
use real information. 

NOTE: For production, you need to use production credentials. For details
contact <<ContactUs, merchant support>>.

All given requests return successful responses.

For more details on the ``redirect-url``, see the 
<<PPSolutions_WPP_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for WPP>>﻿﻿ 
section.

[#WPP_SEPADirectDebit_About]
====== About _SEPA Direct Debit_

image::images/03-01-04-10-sepa-direct-debit/sepadirectdebit_logo.png[SEPA Direct Debit logo, 200]

The Single Euro
Payments Area (SEPA) is an initiative of the European banking industry
that makes electronic payments across the euro area as easy as domestic
payments within one country. The payments are processed under the same
basic conditions, rights, and obligations regardless of their location.

SEPA Direct Debit is a payment method which authorizes a transaction
before it transfers money from the consumer account to the merchant.

[#WPP_SEPADirectDebit_TransactionType_debit]
====== Transaction Type _debit_

A _debit_ transaction charges the specified amount from the account
holder's bank account and marks it for immediate transfer.

For a successful debit transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial debit request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You
find them below.

<<WPP_SEPADirectDebit_TestCredentials, Endpoint>> for _SEPA Direct Debit_ transactions.

.Initial Request

The initial request creates the payment session. If it is
successful, you receive a URL as a response which redirects to the
_SEPA Direct Debit_ payment form.

.2. Redirect the Customer to the Payment Page (Initial Response URL)

At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<PPSolutions_WPP, integration method>>﻿).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled. The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as _failed_, but the
``status description`` indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64-encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_WPP_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for WPP>>﻿﻿
for more details on redirection targets after payment and transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.

[#WPP_SEPADirectDebit_RecurringTransactions]
====== Recurring Transactions

Use WPP to create the first transaction in a series of recurring
transactions. Then use our <<RestApi, REST API>> for all the following transactions (these need to reference the
first one).

To register an initial (first) recurring transaction, use a normal debit
request (like the one in the example above) and add these two fields: 

- ``periodic-type`` , set to value ``recurring`` or ``installment``.
- ``sequence-type`` , set to value ``first``.

//-

The periodic and sequence information indicates that this is the first
transaction in a series. There are no other requirements for the
request.

The ``provider-transaction-reference-id`` returned in the
response contains the ID used to reference all transactions belonging to
a specific recurring group.

For a successful transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You
find them below.

[#WPP_SEPADirectDebit_B2BScheme]
====== B2B Scheme

To use the SEPA B2B scheme for Direct Debit, add the ``b2-b`` field to the
request and set its value to ``true``.

The default value is ``false`` so unless you send this field in the
request as ``true``, the payment proceeds with the default scheme.

[#WPP_SEPADirectDebit_PostProcessing]
====== Post-Processing Operations 
 
WPP is best used to deal with one-off payments (e.g. regular,
independent _debit_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of
them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions).
However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of
post-processing operation — such as a refund of one of your _debit_ transactions 
— use our <<RestApi, REST API>>﻿﻿ directly.

WARNING: A direct refund through WPP is not possible for _SEPA Direct Debit_ so you have to
obtain your consumer's banking information and send the refund using
SEPA Credit Transfer. +
Check the REST API <<SEPACreditTransfer, _SEPA Credit Transfer_ specification>> for details on
_SEPA Direct Debit_ specific post-processing operations.
