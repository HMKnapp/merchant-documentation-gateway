|Transaction Type | Description | Link to samples

|_authorization_    | Performs a creditworthiness check at the moment when
                    consumer makes an order. All order items must be listed for the shopping
                    basket. The _authorization_ amount must match the value of the items in
                    the basket.
                                | <<GuaranteedInstallment_Samples_GuaranteedInstallment, _Guaranteed Installments_ samples>>

|_capture-authorization_ | Used to capture the reserved funds at the moment
                         when some or all goods are physically delivered to the consumer.
                         Available only on successful _authorization_ response which wasn't voided
                         nor fully captured. Partial (and multiple) capture is allowed, until
                         the _authorization_ limit is not exceeded. Basket items only lists the
                         items that were delivered to the consumer in this delivery, not the ones
                         that were delivered before or are waiting to be delivered. The total
                         amount of the capture must be the value of the items in the basket.
                                | <<GuaranteedInstallment_Samples_GuaranteedInstallment, _Guaranteed Installments_ samples>>

|_void-authorization_ | Used when the consumer wishes to cancel some or all
                      (not yet shipped) items from the order. Available only for a successful
                      _authorization_ response which was not yet voided or captured. Partial and
                      multiple void are allowed, until all items from the order are canceled
                      or shipped. Basket items only list those items which are being canceled from the order.
                                | <<GuaranteedInstallment_Samples_GuaranteedInstallment, _Guaranteed Installments_ samples>>

|_refund-capture_ | Used when the consumer wishes to return some or all
                  delivered goods. Available on a successful _capture-authorization_.
                  Partial and multiple refunds are allowed, until all delivered items have
                  been returned. Basket items list only those items which are being returned to the merchant.
                                | <<GuaranteedInstallment_Samples_GuaranteedInstallment, _Guaranteed Installments_ samples>>

|_credit_ | Used when merchant wishes to grant a discount on an existing
          order. Items from this order may already be delivered to the consumer.
          Available on a successful _capture-authorization_. Multiple credits are
          allowed, but the overall sum of credits must not exceed the value of the
          delivered goods to the consumer. The credit transaction must include a
          basket item representing the discount. The credit transaction must refer
          to the successful _authorization_ ``transaction-id``.
                                | <<GuaranteedInstallment_Samples_GuaranteedInstallment, _Guaranteed Installments_ samples>>
|===

[NOTE]
====
. <<GuaranteedInstallment_BasketItemsDetails, Basket items>>  must be specified in every request.
. The response for each _authorization_ request returns an individual
string (an alphanumerical code) in the
field ``descriptor``.
. The descriptor must be printed on all invoice documents and saved by
the shop (used by consumers in bank transfers; German:
"Verwendungszweck").­­
. _capture-authorization_ transactions have to follow a successful
_authorization_ on the same day the goods are dispatched.
. The period between _authorization_ and the first
_capture-authorization_ must be at least 4 hours.
. Merchants can request several partial _capture-authorization_ transactions if the goods
are shipped in separate shipments.

[#GuaranteedInstallment_BasketItemsDetails]
===== Basket Items Details

Basket items details must be sent along with every request. Content of
the shopping basket depends on the location of the items.
There can be 3 different locations:

- the (distribution) storage of the merchant,
- the delivery (items are „on the road"); and
- home of the consumer.

//-

The shopping basket always contains the items that are being authorized
(ordered), captured (delivered), voided (canceled), refunded (returned)
or credited depending to the transaction type.

The detailed items of the shopping basket will be stored as a part of
payment details on provider and they can be obtained from _{payment-gateway}_ later as part of transaction details.
