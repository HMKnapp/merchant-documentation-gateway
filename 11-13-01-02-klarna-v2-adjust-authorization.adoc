[#Klarnav2_TransactionTypes_adjustAuthorization]
===== _adjust-authorization_

Use this transaction type to change a preceding _authorization_ or to add new information to it. 

You  can update

* order number
* order items
* order amount
* consumer's name, billing and shipping address.

[NOTE] 
====
* You can only adjust authorizations that have not yet been captured or canceled.
* Multiple updates are possible.
//-
====

If the change of an authorization results in a higher total order amount, Klarna performs another risk chek. A new risk check can lead to rejection of the
authorization adjustment request. In this case, the initial _authorization_ is
still valid and can be updated, captured or canceled.

To unambiguously refer to a specific _authorization_ or _adjust-authorization_, you need the ``parent-transaction-id``, which is the ``transaction-id`` of the preceding _authorization_ or _adjust-authorization_.
