[#WPP_Sofort]
===== Sofort.

This is a reference page for _Sofort._ Here you find all the information
necessary for integrating this payment method into your Hosted and Embedded Payment Page.

.Are you unfamiliar with Wirecard Payment Page (WPP)?

NOTE: Visit one of the integration guides
(<<PPSolutions_WPP_HPP_HPPintegration, Hosted>>,
<<PPSolutions_WPP_HPP_EPPintegration, Embedded>>) for a quick explanation and
a step-by-step guide before continuing.

All <<PPSolutions_WPP, WPP>> integrations share a
<<PPSolutions_WPP_Workflow, common process flow>>﻿ for creating payments.

Below, you find example requests for the available transaction type
<<WPP_Sofort_TransactionType_debit, _debit_>>, 
including field lists with short descriptions.

These requests are designed for the testing environment and do not
use real information. 

NOTE: For production, you need to use production credentials. For details
contact <<ContactUs, merchant support>>.

All given requests return successful responses.

For more details on the ``redirect-url``, see the 
<<PPSolutions_WPP_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for WPP>>﻿﻿ 
section.

For response verification examples, see
the <<PPSolutions_WPP_WPPSecurity, WPP Security>>﻿ section.

[#WPP_Sofort_TransactionType_debit]
====== Transaction Type _debit_

A _debit_ transaction charges the specified amount from the account
holder's bank account and marks it for immediate transfer.

For a successful debit transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial debit request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You
find them below.

<<WPP_Sofort_TestCredentials, Endpoint>> for _Sofort_ transactions.

.Initial Request

The initial request creates the payment session. If it is
successful, you receive a URL as a response which redirects to the
_Sofort_ payment form.

.2. Redirect the Customer to the Payment Page (Initial Response URL)

[source,json]
----
{
"payment-redirect-url" : "https://wpp.wirecard.com/?wPaymentToken=f0c0e5b3-23ad-4cb4-abca-ed80a0e770e7"
}

[cols="15e,10,75"]
|===
| Field (JSON) | Data Type | Description

| payment-redirect-url | String | The URL which redirects to the payment
form. Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===


At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<PPSolutions_WPP, integration method>>﻿).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled. The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as _failed_, but the
``status description`` indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64-encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_WPP_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for WPP>>﻿﻿
for more details on redirection targets after payment and transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.

[#WPP_Sofort_PostProcessing]
====== Post Processing Operations 

WPP is best used to deal with one-off payments (e.g. regular,
independent _debit_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of
them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions).
However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of
post-processing operation — such as a refund of one of your _debit_ transactions 
— use our <<RestApi, REST API>>﻿﻿ directly.

WARNING: A direct refund through WPP is not possible for Sofort so you have to
obtain your consumer's banking information and send the refund using
SEPA Credit Transfer. +
Check the REST API <<SEPACreditTransfer, _SEPA Credit Transfer_ specification>> for details on
_Sofort_ specific post processing operations.


[#WPP_Sofort_JSON_NVPFields]
====== JSON/NVP Field Reference
