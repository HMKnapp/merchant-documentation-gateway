====== Introduction

image::images/03-02-13-01-fpx/fpx_logo.png[fpx logo, 200]

_FPX_ (Financial Process Exchange) is an online Internet Banking debit payment method that is offered by MyClear (Malaysia Electronic Clearing Corporation Sdn Bhd), which is a subsidiary under Bank Negara Malaysia (i.e. Malaysia's central bank). 

//vhauss: shall we remove "debit" from "...online Internet Banking debit payment method" as WPP V1 supports only "purchase"?
//vhauss: Frage: ist "Internet Banking" nicht immer online? evtl. reicht es sogar, nur zu sagen: "...is an online payment method that is offered by..."

// vhauss added from https://paynet.my/business-fpx.html
// from here
FPX service is suitable for all businesses that offer products or services via the internet. With FPX, all payments are concluded online in real-time basis, making the service as good as cash. Plus, it generates payment records, simplifies reconciliation and reduces risk, thereby encouraging more shoppers to shop online.

All consumers have to do, is to choose their bank before they are sent to their respective bank's internet banking pages to confirm the purchase.
