===== Merchants Integrated with NVP (EPP)

[#PaymentPageSolutions_WPP_EPP_NVP_Migrating]
====== Migrating to WPP

In addition to the new backend-to-backend JSON flow, WPP supports an
updated NVP flow for merchants who already integrated one of the Payment
Page solutions previously and do not want to switch.

In that case, the migration to WPP requires only a few minor
changes. New features have an NVP field equivalent so you can use them
in your integration. Check the <<WPP_Features, WPP Features>> section for specifics.

NOTE: Contact <<ContactUs, merchant support>> for your production credentials.

your ``<head>`` HTML code:
+
[source,html]
----
<script src="https://api-test.wirecard.com/engine/hpp/paymentPageLoader.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
----
+
Replace it with:
+
[source,html]
----
<script src="https://wpp-test.wirecard.com/loader/paymentPage.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
----

. Find the ``embeddedPay`` function call at the end of your ``Pay button`` function:
+
[source,js]
----
WirecardPaymentPage.embeddedPay(requestData);
----
+
Replace it with:

The fields in ``requestData`` remain the same and no changes are needed.
