[#API_CC_TestCards]
=== Test Cards

In this section we provide test cards for a large variety of card brands. These
test cards allow you to provoke a certain behaviour when you send them to our
endpoint. We provide test cards for _3-D Secure_ and _Non 3-D Secure_ transactions.

.Example
If you want to provoke the error status code ``500.1072`` ("_Card Not Enrolled_.")
in combination with a MAESTRO card for a _3-D Secure_ transaction, use
_Card Number_ ``6799860300006000008``, _Expiry Date_ ``01/23`` and _CVC_ ``008``.

[#API_CC_TestCards_3D]
==== 3-D Secure Transactions

When you do a <<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_3DSecure, _3-D Secure_ transaction>>,
WPG checks with the first request, whether the card is enrolled in _3-D Secure_.
A transaction is _3-D Secure_, if the response returns a positive enrollment
check and a positive authentication result.
