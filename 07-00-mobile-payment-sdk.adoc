[#MobilePaymentSDK_Introduction]
=== Introduction

Mobile Payment SDK (MPSDK) is a lightweight user interface for the
Wirecard Payment Gateway.

MPSDK offers a seamless user experience by rendering a payment form as
if it's built in the merchant's mobile application.

This documentation was written for developers who will be integrating
MPSDK into their mobile application. On this page, you will find general
information you need to get started. For integration docs, refer to the
subpage <<MobilePaymentSDK_BasicSetup, Basic Setup and Integration>>.

A list of the currently supported payment methods can be found
in <<MobilePaymentSDK_PaymentMethods, Available Payment Methods>> below.

[#MobilePaymentSDK_FirstSteps]
=== First Steps

Before you start coding, you are going to need some credentials:

. Merchant Account ID - the ID of your merchant account that will be
used to process transactions
. Secret Key - a value that you will use to create unique security
signatures for your transactions

//-

[NOTE]
====
You can find testing credentials at this <<API_CC_TestCards, link>>.

Your account needs to be configured through Merchant Support to process mobile
SDK payments.
====

Get your own credentials by contacting <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>>.

Next, depending on where you are from, you will need to choose your
closest production environment: this is where your instance of MPSDK
will be hosted. Both testing and production environments are available
in every location.

At the moment, the supported locations are as follows:

|===
| Location / Name  | Hostname                                     | SSL cert valid until

| Germany - PROD   | ``\https://api.wirecard.com/``               | 03/12/2020
| Germany - TEST   | ``\https://api-test.wirecard.com/``          | 03/12/2020
| Singapore - PROD | ``\https://api.wirecard.com.sg/``            | 05/21/2020
| Singapore - TEST | ``\https://test.wirecard.com.sg/``           | 09/04/2020
| Toronto - PROD   | ``\https://engine.elastic-payments.com/``    | 08/27/2020
| Toronto - TEST   | ``\https://sandbox-engine.thesolution.com/`` | 12/01/2019

WARNING: Don't forget to keep _MPSDK_ up-to-date (i.e. updating before the SSL
certification expires).

[#MobilePaymentSDK_PaymentMethods]
=== Available Payment Methods

We recommend using <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN, Instant Payment Notification>>, instead
of the default _MPSDK_ responses, as they are much more reliable.
