===== Seamless Integration Workflow

To ensure a seamless and PCI compliant integration, Wirecard serves the
complete payment form as an HTML _iFrame_, which ensures that attacker or
malicious scripts will not have access to data entered on the merchant's
page. The form is then submitted directly to _{payment-gateway}_ over a
secure TLS channel, so the data is securely transported. The high-level
diagram below shows the checkout flow with the optional order summary
page between the payment data collection page and the actual payment:
