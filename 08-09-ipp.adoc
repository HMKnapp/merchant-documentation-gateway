== Installment Payment Plan (IPP)

**I**nstallment **P**ayment **P**lan is a feature that allows the consumer to pay in equal installments. +
Depending on the total order amount, you can offer various payment plans to the consumer. These IPPs differ in tenure and installment payment framework (e.g. interest rate). +
 +
Set up a contract with your issuing bank to agree on the IPP parameters. The issuing bank then provides {payment-provider-name} with these IPP parameters.

////
- **tenure:** duration of installment payment in months. Depends on financial institutions
and ranges from 3 months to 24 months.
- **program:** installment payment framework, e.g.
** minimum amount for installment payments: Only payments with a total amount
higher than this value qualify for installment payment.
** payment delay: The start date of installment payment can be postponed.
** interest rate
////

//-

NOTE: If your merchant account has not yet been set up for IPP, <<ContactUs, contact merchant support>>.

.IPP Characteristics
- *Fixed*: Installments are of equal amount.
- *On-us:* Issuing bank and acquiring bank are the same.
- *Issuer-based:* Post-clearing, you receive the full amount from the acquiring bank. The consumer pays their issuing bank (same entity as acquiring bank since *on-us*) in installments.
- *Domestic payments only:* The instrument country, i.e. the country where the
consumer's card was issued, must match the merchant country.
- *Domestic currency only:* The consumer can only pay in the local currency of the merchant country.
- *Credit card:* This feature is available for credit card payments only. +
_Supported card brands:_
+
* Mastercard
* Visa

=== Setting up IPP
[discrete]
[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_Setup_Prerequisites]
==== Prerequisites
Merchant and issuing bank have to contractually agree upon basic IPP
parameters:

- **tenure:** duration of installment payment. Depends on financial institutions
and ranges from 3 months to 24 months.
- **program:** installment payment framework, e.g.
** minimum amount for installment payments: Only payments with a total amount
higher than this value qualify for installment payment.
** payment delay: The start date of installment payment can be postponed.
** interest rate
** BIN range: valid **B**ank **I**dentification **N**umbers. Lists all
issuing banks that qualify for installment payment.

//-

The issuer provides {payment-provider-name} with these IPP parameters.

[discrete]
[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_Setup_MerchantSetup]
==== Merchant Setup
Merchant setup basically follows the standard setup process. +
You need a **unique MAID** for IPP. +
Two additional features must be activated on the merchant account configuration:

- **installment plan:** Activate ``installment_plan_enabled``.
- **on-us card routing:** Activate ``onus_enabled``.

<<ContactUs, Merchant Support>> assists you in setting up your account properly.

NOTE: The basic IPP parameters must be setup as defined in
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_Setup,Prerequisites>>.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_Scenarios]
=== IPP Scenarios
There are two different IPP scenarios:

1. Consumer has only one credit card.
2. Consumer has several credit cards to select from.

//-
////

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_Workflow]
[discrete]
//==== 1. Consumer has only one credit card
=== Workflow
. The consumer checks out products in the merchant's shop.
. The merchant's shop displays the payment form, where the consumer enters their credit card data (PAN).
. WPG checks the card's IPP eligibility by validating the card number against the BIN ranges activated at the issuing bank.
The BIN range is part of the contract between merchant and issuing bank. It lists all  **B**ank **I**dentification **N**umbers (the first 6 digits of credit card number) that qualify for installment payment.
//+
//The BIN range lists all **B**ank **I**dentification **N**umbers that qualify for installment payment.
+
WPG also checks if the transaction and the transaction currency are domestic.

* Validation fail: The consumer is redirected to the regular (credit card) payment form.
* Validation OK: The consumer can select either regular payment or payment in installments.
. The consumer selects "Payment in Installments".
. The merchant sends an <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_InstallmentCalculator, Installment Calculator>> request to WPG.
. WPG forwards the request to the issuing bank.
. The issuing bank generates a list of all available IPPs and sends it to the merchant.
. The merchant's shop displays the available installment plans to the consumer (on the checkout page).
. The consumer selects an installment plan and submits the payment. The selected program/tenure is sent with the _purchase_ request to WPG.
*Mandatory IPP fields* in this _purchase_ request are <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_Fields, __tenure__>> and <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_Fields, __program-id__>>.
. WPG forwards the request to the issuing bank.
. The issuing bank processes the request and sends the response to WPG.
. WPG forwards the response to the merchant.
. The merchant informs the consumer about the transaction outcome.
. The issuing bank pays the total order amount to the merchant.
. The consumer pays the issuing bank (same
  entity as acquiring bank since *on-us*) in installments.

=== Fields
A _purchase_ request with IPP requires two additional **mandatory** fields that identify the installment plan selected by the consumer:

[%autowidth]

|===
|Field |Data Type |Size |Description

m|tenure
|Integer
|10
|Installment tenure. Number of months the consumer has to pay in installments. +
Enter the respective value from the field ``months`` provided in the Installment Calculator response.

m|program-id
|Alphanumeric
|36
|This ID uniquely identifies the corresponding installment payment plan framework. +
Enter the respective value from the field ``program-id`` provided in the Installment Calculator response.

|===

Two additional fields are sent in the response to this request:

[%autowidth]
|===
|Field |Data Type |Description

m|monthly-pay
|Decimal
|Amount that the consumer pays to the issuing bank per month.

m|interest-rate
|Decimal
|Interest rate of the selected IPP.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_Scenario2]
[discrete]
==== 2. Consumer has multiple credit cards

.Workflow
1. Consumer checks out products in merchant's shop.
2. Merchant forwards payment request to WPG. This request must include the MAID.
3. WPG sends all IPPs that are available for this MAID to the merchant. +
// These IPPs match the IPP criteria such as minimum amount eligible for installment or country and currency of order.
4. Merchant displays these IPPs to consumer.
5. Consumer selects from the list of available banks and list of available programs.
6. Merchant displays payment form, where consumer is to enter card data (PAN).
7. WPG checks card's IPP eligibility by validating the card number against the
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_Setup, BIN ranges>> activated at the issuing bank.
WPG also checks if the transaction is domestic.
** Validation fail: Consumer is redirected to the regular (credit card) payment form.
** Validation OK: Consumer can select either regular payment or payment in
installments.
8. If consumer selects "Payment on Installments", merchant
sends an <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_InstallmentCalculator, Installment Calculator>> request to WPG. This request
contains the order amount and the ISO locale code (including country and
  language).
9. WPG forwards the request to the issuing bank.
10. The issuing bank generates a list of all available IPPs and sends it
to the merchant.
11. Merchant shows the available installment plans to the consumer
(on the checkout page).
12. Consumer selects the appropriate installment plan. By submitting,
   the selected programure is sent with the __purchase__ request to WPG. The mandatory <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_Scenarios_Fields, fields for the __purchase__ request>> are the same as for scenario 1.
