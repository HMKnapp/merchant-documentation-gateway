Wirecard's Payment Page solutions handle the payment method selection as
well as the collection of payment details or consumer redirects to
alternative payment provider sites. With this solution, the merchant
is only required to conform to a limited PCI scope (self-questionnaire
A).

_Wirecard Payment Page v1_ is available in three formats:

- Hosted Payment Page (HPP)
- Embedded Payment Page (EPP)
- Seamless Integration
