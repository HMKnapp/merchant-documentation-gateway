[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Introduction]
===== Introduction


This section describes _Credit Card_ transaction types that can be used with the _Wirecard Payment Processing Gateway_.
For each transaction type we provide a _Credit Card_ specific introduction. We explain the transaction
type's availability and restrictions. We look at the conditions or
preconditions required to process this transaction type.

The access data required to communicate with the endpoint are provided
with the <<CreditCard_TestCredentials, test credentials>>.

You get the best knowledge of our transaction types when you send an XML
request to our endpoint. We describe the content and structure of these
requests in the section "Sending Data". For reference we also provide a
response that can be expected. Where applicable we set up a flow of
subsequent transaction types (e.g. _authorization_ > _capture-authorization_). Refer to the
<<CreditCard_Fields, complete field list>> for credit card transactions.

In ``<statuses>`` of the response you will find a number that represents a
<<ReturnCodes, status code>>.

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_List]
===== List of Transaction Types

Please read about details for the transaction types <<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Authorization, authorization>>,
<<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_CaptureAuthorization, capture-authorization>> and <<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase, purchase>>.

[#CreditCard_TransactionTypes_VoidRefund]
===== void vs. refund


It is often the case that the merchants must withdraw an online shopping
process. When the consumer wants to buy a product or service online,
_Wirecard Payment Processing Gateway_ (WPPG) initiates a payment process. When the
merchants withdraw this process, they can stop the process in two ways.
Either with a void or a refund.

A void is only possible as long as no money transfer has been initiated.
As soon as WPPG has initiated the payment flow to the acquirer the
merchants must return the funds to the consumer via a refund process.

Voiding a transaction requires a reference to the transaction that shall
be voided.

The void transaction contains a <`parent-transaction-id`> that refers to
the <`transaction-id`> of the transaction that shall be voided.

Here is an example how to void a _capture_.

Refunding a transaction requires a reference to the transaction that
shall be refunded.

The refund transaction contains a <`parent-transaction-id`> that refers
to the <`transaction-id`> of the transaction that shall be refunded.

Here is an example how to refund a _capture_.

Running the Test Samples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_
https://www.programmableweb.com/news/review-postman-client-makes-restful-api-exploration-breeze/brief/2014/01/27[Postman]_
is a handy tool to send a request to our endpoints. We optimized our
samples assuming you are using _Postman_.

[[TransactionTypes-1)TheHeader]]
1) The Header
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In __Postman__ you can authorize to the endpoint using the _Basic_ value
given in the
https://document-center.wirecard.com/display/PTD/purchase#purchase-purchaseUsingCardData[_Request
Header_ box] at each request sample. Open the "Headers" section in
_Postman_ and enter the values for the keys "Authorization" and
"Content-Type" as you can find them in the corresponding _Request
Header_ box.

[[TransactionTypes-2)TheBody]]
2) The Body
^^^^^^^^^^^

image:attachments/5406737/5406744.png[image,width=900] +

~^_Postman_ Body section^~

Open _Postman_'s body section, select the option "raw" and copy the
_Request_ sample into the body field. Click _Send_ and our API will
return a response. +

If you don't use _Postman_, use the test credentials as provided in the
corresponding transaction type sample and make sure you replace
\{\{`$guid`}} with a unique value in <`request-id`>. This value has to
be replaced each time before you are sending the request.
