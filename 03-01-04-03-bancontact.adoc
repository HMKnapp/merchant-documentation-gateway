[#WPP_Bancontact_TransactionType_debit]
====== Transaction Type _debit_

A _debit_ transaction charges the specified amount from the account
holder's bank account and marks it for immediate transfer.

For a successful _debit_ transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You can find
them below.

<<WPP_Bancontact_TestCredentials, Endpoint>> for _Bancontact_ transactions.

.Initial Request

This example is an initial request which creates the payment session. If
it is successful, you receive a URL as a response, which redirects to
the _Bancontact_ payment form.

.2. Redirect the consumer to the Payment Page (Initial Response URL)

  "payment-redirect-url": "https://wpp-test.wirecard.com/processing?wPaymentToken=UvnC2LM5QuDotVHTmfV2t4AZn9dJpZNt6dFAwxZHdvU"

----

[cols="25e,15,60"]
|===
|Field (JSON) |Data Type |Description

|payment-redirect-url |String |The URL which redirects to the payment
form. Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===

At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<WPP, integration method>>﻿).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled. The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as _failed_, but the
``status description`` indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64 encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_WPP_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for WPP>>﻿﻿
for more details on redirection targets after payment & transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.
