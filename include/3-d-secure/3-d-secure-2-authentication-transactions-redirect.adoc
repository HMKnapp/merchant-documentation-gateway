Send an HTTPS POST request including the ACS URL, the ``PAReq``, ``TermUrl`` and ``MD``.

* The ``TermUrl`` is the web address of your server to receive the ``PARes`` (Payment Authentication response).
* The ``MD`` is a hidden field reserved for specific merchant data. The ``MD`` may be useful for retrieving transaction data from the database or recalling a transaction.

//-

NOTE: The ``MD`` field is _mandatory_. Make sure to include it in the request. You do not need to enter a value. +
If you omit this field, an authentication error occurs and the payment process is aborted. 

Once the consumer has been redirected, they receive an authentication prompt. The consumer enters their data. After successful authentication, the SSL-encrypted and digitally signed ``PARes`` (Payment Authentication Response) is posted to the ``TermURL`` via the consumer's browser.
