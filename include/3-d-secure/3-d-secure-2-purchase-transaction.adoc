.*purchase*

This final step in the transaction flow must reference either the previous check-enrollment or the check-payer-response. This depends on whether the check-payer-response has been executed or not.
--
.. Following check-enrollment: use the ``transaction-id`` from this response as the ``parent-transaction-id`` value in the purchase request.
.. Following (optional) check-payer-response: use the ``transaction-id`` from this response as the ``parent-transaction-id`` value in the purchase request.
--
If the check-payer-response was not executed, use instead the *PARes* received via TermURL as part of the response to the ACS HTTP POST request.
