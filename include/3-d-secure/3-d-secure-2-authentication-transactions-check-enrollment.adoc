.*check-enrollment* 

This is the initial request in a 3D Secure 2 payment flow. It initiates the payment session and checks if the consumer's card is enrolled in the 3D Secure 2 program.

New 3D Secure 2 fields can be found in the <<CreditCard_3DS2_Fields, 3D Secure 2 field table>>. +
ifdef::env-wirecard[]
ifndef::env-nova[]
They are also included in the <<Appendix_Xml, REST API payment XSD>>.
endif::[]
endif::[]

CAUTION: For 3D Secure 2 transactions, include the new field ``three-d/version`` and set its value to ``2.1``. 

As a result of the check-enrollment, you receive the *PAReq* with the ACS URL.

See the <<CreditCard_Samples_CheckEnrollment_3DS2, XML request/response samples for check-enrollment>>.
