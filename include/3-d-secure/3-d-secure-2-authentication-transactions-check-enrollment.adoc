This is the initial request in a 3D Secure 2 payment flow. It initiates the payment session and checks if the consumer's card is enrolled in the 3D Secure 2 program.

CAUTION: For 3D Secure 2 transactions, include the ``three-d/version`` field and set its value to ``2.1``. +
If you do not enter a value, the field defaults to ``1.0``.

As a result of the check-enrollment, you receive the ``PAReq`` with the ACS URL.
