Consumer's **P**ersonal **I**dentification **N**umber data for card present payments. +
Card present transaction processing can be initiated by

* a **point of sale terminal** (PIN pad) transaction processed online (and/or offline). The terminal accepts, encrypts and forwards the cardholder's PIN.
* a **mobile device** transaction using a mobile SDK. +
For mobile device initiated transactions, there is typically a backend server that integrates to the Payment Gateway for payment transactions processing. This is to ensure that the credentials connecting to the gateway are not published in mass consumer devices.
