//KKS: Field description info from "riid" to "ds-transaction" taken from: https://doc.wirecard.com/CreditCard.html#CreditCard_3DS2_Fields

//KKS: Should this table also contain all 3DS fields (1 & 2)? Personally, I would think it would make sense to have it all in one place. See: https://doc.wirecard.com/CreditCard.html#CreditCard_3DS2_Fields - still pending updates!
