EMV cards are smart cards (also called chip cards or IC cards) that store their data on integrated
circuits in addition to magnetic stripes (for backward compatibility). These
include cards that must be physically inserted (or "dipped") into a reader, as
well as contactless cards that can be read over a short distance using
near-field communication (NFC) technology. (Taken from Wikipedia)
// KKS: OK as an internal reference but in my opinion not needed here. Maybe describe card types separately?
