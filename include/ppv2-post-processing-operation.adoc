[#PPv2_paydirekt_PostProcessing]
====== Post-Processing Operations 

{payment-page-v2-abbr} is best used to deal with one-off payments (e.g. regular,
independent _debit_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of
them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions).
However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of
post-processing operation — such as a refund for one of your transactions 
— use our <<RestApi, REST API>>﻿﻿ directly.

WARNING: A direct refund through {payment-page-v2-abbr} is not possible for _{payment-method-name}_ so you have to
obtain your consumer's banking information and send the refund using
_SEPA Credit Transfer_. +
Check the REST API <<SEPACreditTransfer, _SEPA Credit Transfer_ specification>> for details on _{payment-method-name}_ specific post-processing operations.
