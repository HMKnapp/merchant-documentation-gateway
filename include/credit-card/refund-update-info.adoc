We are updating refund transactions for credit card (Mastercard and Visa). 

The update adds a new field ``authorization-code`` for the response to a refund-request. 

* If your refund-request is successful, the response will contain the ``authorization-code`` and a 6-digit value.
* If the issuer declines the refund-request, the response will not contain the ``authorization-code``.
