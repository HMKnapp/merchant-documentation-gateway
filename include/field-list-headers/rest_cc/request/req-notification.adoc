``notification`` is a child of <<CC_Fields_{listname}_request_payment, payment.notifications>>.

``notification`` is used to set up <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN, Instant Payment Notification (IPN)>>. It is highly recommended to use IPN. IPN informs you about the outcome of the individual payment processes. By including ``notification`` in the request you can overwrite the <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Configuration, merchant account configuration>>.
