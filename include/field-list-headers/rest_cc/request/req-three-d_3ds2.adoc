``three-d`` is a child of <<CC_Fields_{listname}_request_payment, payment>>.

NOTE: For a 3D Secure 2 payment process *you must send* content in all the M/O fields ``acs-url``, ``cardholder-authentication-status``, ``cardholder-authentication-value``, ``ds-transaction-id``, ``eci``, ``pareq``, ``pares`` and ``xid``. If you omit one of them, ACS will reduce your payment process to a regular 3D Secure payment process. +
You receive some of the values during the payment process, e.g. when you communicate with the ACS server.
