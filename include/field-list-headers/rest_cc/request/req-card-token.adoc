``card-token`` is a child of <<CC_Fields_xmlelements_request_payment, payment>> and is the substitute for <<CC_Fields_xmlelements_request_card, card>>. Due to
<<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_Tokenization_Introduction, PCI DSS>> compliance, ``card`` data must not be sent in payment transactions. The _{payment-gateway}_ replaces ``card`` immediately with a token in the transaction response for the first use of a credit card.
