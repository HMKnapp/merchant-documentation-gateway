``address`` is a child of
<<CC_Fields_{listname}_request_accountholder, account-holder>> and <<CC_Fields_{listname}_request_shipping, shipping>>. It is used to specify the consumer's address and can refer to

- the consumer (for ``account-holder``). The account holder's address is used as the billing address.
- the consumer's shipping address (for ``shipping``). For 3D Secure 2 transactions it is highly recommended to send ``shipping.address`` data in any case, as a complete set of ``shipping.address`` data reduces the likelihood of a challenge test.

Data can be provided optionally but it is strongly recommended to provide as much as possible.+
A complete ``address`` list makes fraud checks much easier.
