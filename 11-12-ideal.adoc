iDEAL is an e-commerce payment method widely used in the Netherlands.
Introduced in 2005, this payment method allows consumers to buy on the
Internet using direct online transfers from their bank account, i.e.
payments are made directly between bank accounts. iDEAL works together
with leading Dutch banks using the banks' online banking systems to
carry out payment transactions.
--

Since the introduction of SEPA, iDEAL payments may be carried out from
and to all European bank accounts (in EUR). However, in order to enable
consumers outside The Netherlands to use this payment method, their bank
must have an iDEAL license from Currence, the trademark owner and
supervisory authority for iDEAL.

.Advantages for Merchants

* When offering iDEAL in your online shop, a direct link is established
with the systems of your own bank or online financial service provider.
* Virtually risk-free: consumers may not reverse the payment (no
chargeback).
* Payments are credited to the merchant´s account as fast as any
conventional credit transfer.
* Paying via their own familiar banking environment reassures consumers
of a high payment security and leads to a higher conversion rate.

.Advantages for Consumers

* Easy to access, simple to use and free of cost.
* Very convenient since consumers use the same familiar environment as
their bank´s online banking platform.
* Consumer´s name and bank account number are not disclosed until
consumer approves the payment.
* Immediately after completing the purchase, the consumer receives a
confirmation message.
* The consumer´s online bank account summary is also updated.
* No sensitive information is disclosed to the merchant.
