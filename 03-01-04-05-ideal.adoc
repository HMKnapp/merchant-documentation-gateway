====== General Information

This is a reference page for _iDEAL_. Here you'll find all the
information necessary for integrating this payment method in
your Hosted and Embedded Payment Page.

.Are you unfamiliar with Wirecard Payment Page (WPP)?

NOTE: Visit one of the integration guides
(<<PaymentPageSolutions_WPP_HPP_Integration, Hosted>>,
<<PaymentPageSolutions_WPP_EPP_Integration, Embedded>>) for a quick explanation and
a step-by-step guide before continuing.

All <<PPSolutions_WPP, WPP>> integrations share a
<<PPSolutions_WPP_Workflow, common process flow>>﻿ for creating payments.

Below, you find example requests for <<WPP_ideal_TransactionType_debit, _debit_>>, 
including field lists with short descriptions.

These requests are designed for the testing environment and do not
use real information. 

NOTE: For production, you need to use production credentials. For details
contact our <<ContactUs, merchant support>>.

All given requests return successful responses.

For more details on the ``redirect-url``, see the 
<<PPSolutions_WPP_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for WPP>>﻿﻿ 
section.

[#WPP_ideal_About]
====== About _iDEAL_

image::images/03-01-04-05-ideal/ideal_logo.png[image,width=80]
_iDEAL_ is an e-commerce payment method widely used in the Netherlands.
Introduced in 2005, this payment method allows consumers to buy on the Internet
using direct online transfers from their bank account. _iDEAL_ works together
with leading Dutch banks using their online banking systems to carry out
payment transactions.

[#WPP_ideal_TransactionType_debit]
====== Transaction Type _debit_

A debit transaction charges the specified amount from the account
holder's bank account and marks it for immediate transfer.

For a successful _debit_ transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response. +

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You
can find them below.

<<WPP_ideal_TestCredentials, Endpoint>> for _iDEAL_ payments.

.Initial Request

The initial request creates the payment session. If it's
successful, you receive a URL as a response which redirects to the
_iDEAL_ payment form.

``{{$guid}}`` serves as a placeholder for a random ``request-id``.

Allowed characters: [a-z0-9-_]

_iDEAL_ payments, the transaction-type must be set to _debit_.

.2. Redirect the consumer to the Payment Page (Initial Response URL)

////
In the following table we do not provide data for "size" and "cardinality"
////

[cols="<,<,<",]
|===
|Field (JSON) |Data Type |Description

|payment-redirect-url |String |The URL which redirects to the payment
form. Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===

At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an ``iframe`` depending on your
<<PPSolutions_WPP, integration method>>﻿).

The consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state``: _success_),
- failed (``transaction-state``: _failed_),
- canceled. The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state``: _failed_).

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as ``transaction-state``: _failed_, but the
status description indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64 encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_WPP_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for WPP>>﻿﻿
for more details on redirection targets after payment & transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.

[#WPP_ideal_PostProcessing]
====== Post Processing Operations

WPP is best used to deal with "one-off" payments (e.g. regular,
independent _debit_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of
them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions).
However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of
post processing operations — like a refund of one of your _[TRANSACTION TYPE NAME]_ transactions 
— use our <<RestApi, REST API>>﻿﻿ directly. Check the REST API
<<iDEAL, _iDEAL_ specification>> for details on
_iDEAL_ specific post processing operations.

////
I rewrote the following sentence, as the information given in our Doc-Center
is missleading. iDEAL only supports "debit" all post processes must be performed
via SEPA.
////

_iDEAL_ with WPP supports _debit_ only. For refund,
use <<SEPACreditTransfer, SEPA Credit Transfer>> (if SEPA Credit Transfer is
activated for your merchant account) through our <<RestApi, REST API>>.
