We offer you various shop plugins which you are able to
use *free-of-charge* to add payment functionality to your online shop
system. Therefore you only need to download/install our shop plugin to
your online shop and to configure it to your needs.

Some shop systems refer to these shop plugins as "extension", as
"add-on" or as "module". However, for the purpose of better legibility,
we call all of them "shop plugins" within this documentation.

All our shop plugins require *only PCI SAQ A* certification for credit
card payments which you may achieve very easily.

You are able to *test the shop plugin* features and functionality via
pre-configured test accounts for each payment method. For going live you
need your personal credentials which you receive from Wirecard after
concluding a corresponding contract. Please contact therefore
our <<ShopSystems_ContactUs, sales and support teams>>.

All our shop plugins are developed and offered as *open source* on link:https://github.com/wirecard[GitHub]. This means you are able
to use them free-of-charge, have full access to the source code and are
able to do forks, raise issues or do contributions. You can find more
information regarding this topic in our Wirecard Blog
regarding link:https://blog.wirecard.com/simply-uncomplicated-what-is-open-payment/[Open Payment].

Please have a look on
our <<ShopSystems_TermsOfUse, Terms of Use and Legal Notice>> before you use our shop plugins in your online
shop.

.Currently we offer shop plugins for the following shop systems:
