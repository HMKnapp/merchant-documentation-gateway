Wirecard Payment Page Designer (PPD) is an intuitive web-tool for
customizing hosted and embedded payment pages. It provides tools to
customize and add fonts, colors, effects, backgrounds, and logos to
create themes, which can be exported/imported for further editing or
used immediately on the merchant website. PPD allows merchants to create
attractive designsÂ in minutes with little technical expertise, whenever
they need. Carefully selected fonts, backgrounds, color schemes and
icons provide a powerful starter bundle, with additional tools offering
further depth of customization.
