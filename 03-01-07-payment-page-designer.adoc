- fonts,
- colors, 
- effects, 
- backgrounds,
- logos

With _PPD_ merchants can create themes. The themes can be either exported/imported for further editing or used immediately on the merchant's website. 

A default set of carefully selected fonts, color schemes, backgrounds and icons are combined in a starter bundle. Additional tools allow further depth of customization.

With the starter bundle merchants can customize their payment page to meet the demands of modern branding and image standards.

Use the starter bundle
