[#API_CC_TestCards]
==== Test Cards

In this section we provide test cards for a large variety of card brands. These
test cards allow you to provoke a certain behaviour when you send them to our
endpoint. We provide test cards for _3D Secure_ and _Non-3D Secure_ transactions.

.Example
If you want to provoke the error status code ``500.1072`` ("_Card Not Enrolled_.")
in combination with a MAESTRO card for a _3D Secure_ transaction, use
_Card Number_ ``6799860300006000008``, _Expiration Date_ ``01/23`` and _CVC_ ``008``.

[#API_CC_TestCards_ExpirationDates]
NOTE: *For all cards*: The expiration date is always:
<expiration-month>01</expiration-month>,
<expiration-year>2023</expiration-year>

[#API_CC_TestCards_3D]
===== 3D Secure Transactions

When you do a <<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_3DSecure, _3D Secure_ transaction>>,
WPG checks with the first request, whether the card is enrolled in _3D Secure_.
A transaction is _3D Secure_, if the response returns a positive enrollment
check and a positive authentication result.

[#CreditCard_3DS2_TestCards]
===== 3D Secure 2 Transactions

For 3D Secure and 3D Secure 2 transactions, the first request is always a *check-enrollment.* For 3D Secure 2 enrollment checks, it is necessary to provide the ``three-d.version`` with the value ``2.1``. 

CAUTION: WPG uses the default value ``1.0`` if the version is not provided in the request. 

A successful *check-enrollment* returns the ``three-d/pareq``. The PAReq is the digitally signed, base64-encoded authentication request message created by Wirecard Payment Gateway. It contains the results of the 3D Secure versioning request.

The merchant uses the PAReq for a HTTPS POST redirect of the consumer to the ACS URL, which is part of a standard 3D Secure process. The HTTPS POST redirect returns the PARes, which contains the authentication result, as part of the response.

The transaction is secured with 3D Secure 2, if the response returns a positive authentication result.

This section provides card numbers and CVCs which you can use to provoke certain
Non-3D responses.
To obtain the required response, send a
<<CreditCard_TransactionTypes_Purchase_SendingData_PurchaseUsingCardData, _purchase_>>
request to our endpoint using the corresponding card details provided here.

For example: If you want to provoke the message "The card type is not processed
by the authorization center.  Please contact technical support."
(Status Code = 500.1061) for a MAESTRO card,
