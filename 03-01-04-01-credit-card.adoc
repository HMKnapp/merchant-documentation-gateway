[#WPP_CC_General]
====== General Information

This is a reference page for _Credit Card._ Here you find all the
information necessary for integrating this payment method in
your Hosted and Embedded Payment Page.

.Are you unfamiliar with Wirecard Payment Page (WPP)?

NOTE: Visit one of the integration guides
(<<PaymentPageSolutions_WPP_HPP_Integration, Hosted>>,
<<PaymentPageSolutions_WPP_EPP_Integration, Embedded>>) for a quick explanation and
a step-by-step guide before continuing.

All <<WPP, WPP>> integrations share a
<<PPSolutions_WPP_Workflow, common process flow>>﻿ for creating payments.

Below, you find example requests for all available transaction types, 
including field lists with short descriptions.

These requests are designed for the testing environment and do not
use real information. 

NOTE: For production, you need to use production credentials. For details
contact our <<ContactUs, merchant support>>.

All given requests return successful responses.

For more details on the ``redirect-url``, see the 
<<PPSolutions_WPP_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for WPP>>﻿﻿ 
section.

For response verification examples, see
the <<PPSolutions_WPP_WPPSecurity, WPP Security>>﻿ section.

WPP can be used with the _Credit Card_ transaction types
<<WPP_CC_TransactionType_purchase, _purchase_>>,
<<WPP_CC_TransactionType_authorization, _authorization_>> and
<<WPP_CC_TransactionType_authorizationonly, _authorization-only_>>.

[#WPP_CC_TransactionType_purchase]
====== Transaction Type _purchase_

A _purchase_ transaction charges the account holder's card and immediately
transfers the reserved amount.

For a successful transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You

|===

At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<WPP, integration method>>﻿).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled. The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as ``transaction-state``: _failed_, but the
``status description`` indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64 encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_WPP_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for WPP>>﻿﻿
for more details on redirection targets after payment & transaction status
notifications.

[#WPP_CC_TransactionType_authorization]
====== Transaction Type _authorization_

An _authorization_ transaction places the account holder's funds on hold,
pending future capture, re-authorization or void transaction.

As with other referenceable transaction types, you can use WPP only to
create the authorization itself. To capture or register additional
transactions referencing it, you need to use
our <<WPP_CC_PostProcessing, REST API>>. 

For a successful transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

[#WPP_CC_3DSecure]
===== _Credit Card_ with 3-D Secure

To process 3-D Secure transactions, you need to have them enabled on
your merchant account. Contact <<ContactUs, merchant support>> if 3-D Secure
was not enabled for you during Merchant setup.

NOTE: If a consumer card is not 3-D enrolled and ``attempt-three-d`` is set
to ``true``, the payment fails.

To process a card payment with 3-D Secure enabled:

Add the ``attempt-three-d`` field to the payment request and set it
to ``true``.

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You
can find them below.

.Initial Request

The initial request creates the payment session. If it's
successful, you receive a URL as a response which redirects to the
payment form.

.2. Redirect the Consumer to the Payment Page (Initial Response URL)

[cols="25e,10,65"]
|===
|Field (JSON) | Data Type | Description

|payment-redirect-url |String |The URL which redirects to the payment
form. Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===

At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<WPP, integration method>>﻿).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled. The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as _failed_, but the
``status description`` indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64 encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_WPP_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for WPP>>﻿﻿
for more details on redirection targets after payment & transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.

[#WPP_CC_3DS2Fields]
====== 3-D Secure 2 - Additional Fields

To create a payment session with *Credit Card using 3-D Secure 2 authentication,* 
you need to *include additional 3-D Secure 2 fields in your initial request.*

Most of these fields are optional but we recommend the implementation of
optional fields, as this creates a smoother user experience and ensures
a higher level of security.

[#WPP_CC_PostProcessing]
====== Post Processing Operations 

WPP is best used to deal with "one-off" payments (e.g. regular,
independent _debit_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of
them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions).
However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of
post processing operations — like a refund of one of your _debit_ transactions 
— use our <<RestApi, REST API>>﻿﻿ directly. Check the REST API
<<CreditCard, _Credit Card_ specification>> for details on _Credit Card_
specific post processing operations.

There are multiple post processing operations available for _Credit Card_:

- _capture_ operations for both _authorization_ and _authorization-only_,
- recurring transactions,
- _void_ transactions,
- refunds,
- and more.

//-

For examples and more information, see the REST
API <<CreditCard, _Credit Card_ specification>>﻿﻿.
