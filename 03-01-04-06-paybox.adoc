[#WPP_paybox_General]
====== General Information

This is a reference page for _paybox_. Here you find all the
information necessary for integrating this payment method in
your Hosted and Embedded Payment Page.

.Are you unfamiliar with Wirecard Payment Page (WPP)?

NOTE: Visit one of the integration guides
(<<PaymentPageSolutions_WPP_HPP_Integration, Hosted>>,
<<PaymentPageSolutions_WPP_EPP_Integration, Embedded>>) for a quick explanation and
a step-by-step guide before continuing.

All <<WPP, WPP>> integrations share a
<<PPSolutions_WPP_Workflow, common process flow>>﻿ for creating payments.

Below, you find an example request for the _purchase_ and _authorization_
transaction types, including field lists with short descriptions.

You need to complete these requests with your production credentials.
You receive your credentials with your Wirecard contract. If you
need your production credentials, contact our <<ContactUs, merchant support>>.

////
paybox does not provide explicit test data. The merchant must perform his tests
with the production credentials. This is a very specific case and should be
described in an info box!
////

.Testing _paybox_

NOTE: _paybox_ does not offer a payment testing sandbox.
You need to test transactions with your production credentials.

For more details on the ``redirect-url``, see the 
<<PPSolutions_WPP_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for WPP>>﻿﻿ 
section.

For response verification examples, see
the <<PPSolutions_WPP_WPPSecurity, WPP Security>>﻿ section.

[#WPP_paybox_About]
====== About _paybox_

image::images\03-01-04-06-paybox/paybox_logo.png[image,width=250]

_paybox_ is an Austrian mobile payment provider for mobile payments in Austria.
Consumers with a bank account in Austria, Switzerland or the European
Economic Area and a valid contract with an Austrian mobile phone
provider can set up a direct debit agreement with _paybox_. Using their
mobile phone, they can pay in (online) shops, at (ticket) vending
machines, for mobile parking, ...

[#WPP_paybox_Countries]
====== Countries and Currencies

_paybox_ can be used by consumers with a bank account
in Austria, Switzerland or the European Economic Area and a valid
contract with an Austrian mobile phone provider.

As _paybox_ is an Austrian payment method, the only available payment
currency for consumers is EUR.

Two transaction types are available for _paybox_:

- _purchase_
- <<WPP_paybox_TransactionType_authorization, _authorization_>>

[#WPP_paybox_TransactionType_purchase]
====== Transaction Type _purchase_

A purchase transaction immediately transfers the order amount from the
consumer's account to the merchant's account.

A purchase is

. created during payment processing and
. finalized with the response (confirmation of the initial purchase
request).

*Purchase workflow in detail:*

1.  The consumer provides their phone number and initiates the purchase
transaction (e.g. by clicking the "Pay Now" button).
2.  The merchant sends an initial purchase request to Wirecard.
3.  As a response, the merchant receives the `payment-redirect-url` with
a `PaymentToken`.
4.  The merchant must use this `payment-redirect-url` (hosted by
_paybox_) to redirect the consumer.
5.  On the _paybox_ payment page, the consumer enters their _paybox_ PIN and
submits the payment.
6.  _paybox_ processes the consumer's input and sends the transaction
status to Wirecard.
7.  The consumer is redirected to the WPP processing page.
8.  After the transaction has been approved, the consumer is redirected
back to the merchant's shop (redirection URLs,
see link:#payboxwithWPP-PurchaseSampleRequest[sample request]). There,
the consumer and the merchant are notified about the outcome of the
payment process. +
We **recommend** that the merchant includes
a **notification-URL** (see link:#payboxwithWPP-PurchaseSampleRequest[sample
request]) to receive a payment notification directly from Wirecard
Payment Gateway.

////
Why do we have here a detailed purchase workflow? We state in line 18, 19 that all
payment process are the same. All other payment methods do not show such a
detailed workflow.
I didn't clean it up, because I'd suggest to remove it from here.
////

For a successful _purchase_ transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial purchase request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

We provide JSON examples for each step of this process. You can find
them below. You need to adapt the field values to your system.

|===
|Field (JSON) |Data Type |Description

|payment-redirect-url |String |The URL which redirects to the payment
form (hosted by _paybox_). Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===

At this point, you need to redirect your customer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<WPP, integration method>>﻿).

The customers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled. The customer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as  _failed_, but the status description indicates it
was canceled.

In any case (unless the customer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64 encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_WPP_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for WPP>>﻿﻿
for more details on redirection targets after payment & transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.

[#WPP_paybox_TransactionType_authorization]
====== Transaction Type _authorization_

An _authorization_

- reserves funds on a consumer's account (e.g. until the merchant
ships/delivers the goods/services).
- does not trigger money transfer.  

The authorization workflow is similar to
the link:#payboxwithWPP-Purchase[purchase workflow].

////
According to my comment in line 110ff, we don't need the above link, as the
workflow is obsolete.
////

For a successful _authorization_ transaction

. Create an authorization session (initial authorization request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

We provide JSON examples for each step of this process. You can find
them below. You need to adapt the field values to your system.

.How to proceed after an authorization

To transfer money, the authorized amount has to be captured. WPP does
not support capturing. However, you can capture an authorization using
the <<RestApi, REST API>>,

if

- the authorization was successful AND has not yet been captured AND has not
been voided (which can also be done using the <<RestApi, REST API>>)
- you provide the ``parent-transaction-id``: This is the ``transaction-id`` of
the preceding _authorization_. You can gather it from the response to a
successful _authorization_.

Click the REST API <<API_paybox, _paybox_ specification>> for details.

[#WPP_paybox_TransactionType_refund]
====== Transaction Type _refund_

Basically, _paybox_ with WPP supports only _purchase_ and _authorization_.
However, you can use
the <<RestApi, REST API>> for refunds. _paybox_ supports _refund-capture_
and _refund-purchase_.

You must provide the necessary data:

- ``parent-transaction-id``: This is the transaction ID of the preceding
debit. You can gather it from the response to a successful debit.
- ``amount`` (can be either the total amount for refunding the full
amount, or a partial amount for a partial refund)

Click the REST API <<API_paybox, _paybox_ specification>> for details.
