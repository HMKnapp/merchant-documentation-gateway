This is a reference page for *paybox*. Here you find all the information
necessary for integrating this payment method in
your https://document-center.wirecard.com/display/PTD/HPP+Integration[Hosted] and https://document-center.wirecard.com/display/PTD/EPP+Integration[Embedded] Payment
Page.

Are you familiar with Wirecard Payment Page (WPP)?

Visit one of the integration guides
(*https://document-center.wirecard.com/display/PTD/HPP+Integration[Hosted]* or **https://document-center.wirecard.com/display/PTD/EPP+Integration[Embedded] **Payment
Page) for a quick explanation & a step-by-step guide before
continuing. +
All
https://document-center.wirecard.com/display/PTD/Wirecard+Payment+Page[*WPP*]
integrations share a
*https://document-center.wirecard.com/display/PTD/WPP+Workflow[common
process flow]* for creating payments.

Below, you find example requests for each transaction type
(link:#payboxwithWPP-Purchase[purchase] and link:#payboxwithWPP-Authorization[authorization]),
including field lists with short descriptions.

You need to complete these requests with your production credentials.
You receive your credentials with your Wirecard contract. If you
need your production
credentials, contact link:Contact-Us_4391175.html[merchant support].

Testing paybox

paybox does not offer a payment testing sandbox. +
You have to test transactions with your production credentials.

For more details on the `redirect-url`s, see

*About paybox*

image:attachments/5210117/5406779.png[image,width=250]paybox is an
Austrian mobile payment provider for mobile payments in Austria.
Consumers with a bank account in Austria, Switzerland or the European
Economic Area and a valid contract with an Austrian mobile phone
provider can set up a direct debit agreement with paybox. Using their
mobile phone, they can pay in (online) shops, at (ticket) vending
machines, for mobile parking, ...

'''''

[[payboxwithWPP-CountriesandCurrencies]]
Countries and Currencies
------------------------

paybox can be used by consumers with a bank account
in *Austria*, *Switzerland* or the *European Economic Area* and a valid
contract with an *Austrian mobile phone provider*.

As paybox is an Austrian payment method, the only available payment
currency for consumers is *EUR*.

 

'''''

[[payboxwithWPP-TransactionTypes]]
Transaction Types
-----------------

Two transaction types are available for *paybox:*

* link:#payboxwithWPP-Purchase[Purchase]
* link:#payboxwithWPP-Authorization[Authorization]

[[payboxwithWPP-PurchasePurchase]]
[[payboxwithWPP-Purchase]]Purchase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A purchase transaction immediately transfers the order amount from the
consumer's account to the merchant's account.

A purchase is

* created during payment processing and
* finalized with the response (confirmation of the initial purchase
request).

*Purchase workflow in detail:*

1.  The consumer provides their phone number and initiates the purchase
transaction (e.g. by clicking the "Pay Now" button).
2.  The merchant sends an initial purchase request to Wirecard.
3.  As a response, the merchant receives the `payment-redirect-url` with
a `PaymentToken`.
4.  The merchant must use this `payment-redirect-url` (hosted by
paybox) to redirect the consumer.
5.  On the paybox payment page, the consumer enters their paybox PIN and
submits the payment.
6.  paybox processes the consumer's input and sends the transaction
status to Wirecard.
7.  The consumer is redirected to the WPP processing page.
8.  After the transaction has been approved, the consumer is redirected
back to the merchant's shop (redirection URLs,
see link:#payboxwithWPP-PurchaseSampleRequest[sample request]). There,
the consumer and the merchant are notified about the outcome of the
payment process. +
We **recommend** that the merchant includes
a **notification-URL** (see link:#payboxwithWPP-PurchaseSampleRequest[sample
request]) to receive a payment notification directly from Wirecard
Payment Gateway.

 +

Step by step guide to a successful purchase transaction

1.  Create a payment session (initial purchase request).
2.  Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
3.  Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

We provide JSON examples for each step of this process. You can find
them below. You need to adapt the field values to your system.

|=======================================================================
|*Field (JSON)* |*Data Type* |*Description*

|payment-redirect-url |String |The URL which redirects to the payment
form (hosted by paybox). Sent as a response to the initial request.
|=======================================================================

The response to this link:#payboxwithWPP-PurchaseSampleRequest[initial
purchase request] is the `payment-redirect-url`. +
At this point, you need to redirect your consumer
to `payment-redirect-url` where the consumer is to enter payment
details.

The consumer is redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. The response can

* be successful (`transaction-state: success`)
* fail (`transaction-state: failed`)
* or the consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(`transaction-state: failed`).

The transaction result is the value of `transaction-state `in the
payment response. More details (including the
link:#payboxwithWPP-StatusCode[status code]) can also be found in the
payment response in the `statuses` object. Canceled payments are
returned as `"transaction-state" : "failed"`, but the
link:#payboxwithWPP-StatusDescription[status description] indicates it
was canceled.

In any case, a base64 encoded response containing payment information is
sent to one of the configured redirection URLs
(`success-redirect-url`, `cancel-redirect-url`, or `fail-redirect-url`).

See https://confluence.wirecard.sys/display/PTD/Configuring+Redirects+and+IPNs+for+WPP[Configuring
Redirects and IPNs for WPP] for more details on redirection targets
after payment. You can find a decoded payment response example below.

[[payboxwithWPP-AuthorizationAuthorization]]
[[payboxwithWPP-Authorization]]Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An authorization

* reserves funds on a consumer's account (e.g. until the merchant
ships/delivers the goods/services).
* does not trigger money transfer.  

The authorization workflow is similar to
the link:#payboxwithWPP-Purchase[purchase workflow].

 

For a successful authorization transaction

1.  Create an authorization session (initial authorization request).
2.  Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
3.  Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

How to proceed after an authorization:

To transfer money, the authorized amount has to be captured. WPP does
not support capturing. However, you can capture an authorization using
the https://document-center.wirecard.com/display/PTD/REST+API[REST
API] if

* the authorization was successful and
* has not yet been captured and
* has not been voided (which can also be done using
the https://document-center.wirecard.com/display/PTD/REST+API[REST API])
* you provide the `parent-transaction-id`: This is the transaction ID of
the preceding authorization. You can gather it from the response to a
successful authorization.

Click the REST API
https://document-center.wirecard.com/display/PTD/paybox[paybox
specification] for details.

[[payboxwithWPP-Refund]]
Refund
------

Basically, paybox with WPP supports only purchase and authorization. +
However, you can use
the **https://document-center.wirecard.com/display/PTD/REST+API[REST
API] **for refunds. paybox supports refund-capture and refund-purchase.

You must provide the necessary data:

* `parent-transaction-id`: This is the transaction ID of the preceding
purchase/captured authorization. You can gather it from the response to
a successful purchase/captured authorization.
* `amount` (can be either the total amount for refunding the full
amount, or a partial amount for a partial refund).

Click the REST
API https://document-center.wirecard.com/display/PTD/paybox[paybox
specification] for details.
