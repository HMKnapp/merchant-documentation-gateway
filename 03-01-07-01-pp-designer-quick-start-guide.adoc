[#PaymentPageDesigner_QuickStartGuide]
===== Quick Start Guide

{payment-provider-name} Payment Page Designer (PPD) is an intuitive web-tool for
customizing hosted and embedded payment pages. It offers numerous ways
to customize and add fonts, colors, effects, backgrounds, and logos to
create themes which can be exported (and imported for further editing),
or used immediately on your checkout page.

This guide aims to provide a brief overview of the tool's capabilities
and instructions on how to use them.

The PPD's GUI has 3 basic parts:

. Live preview in the middle
. Options menu on the right
. View selector on top left

//-

[#PaymentPageDesigner_QuickStartGuide_Livepreview]
*1. Live preview*

The preview updates itself whenever you customize - or add - something
using the tool rack. It is always visible and wholly reactive,
essentially providing you with a real model of how your design will look
when deployed.

[#PaymentPageDesigner_QuickStartGuide_Optionsmenu]
*2. Options Menu*

This is where you will make all the adjustments, edits and choose
settings. Most of this guide will be dedicated to going through the
separate sections of this menu.

[#PaymentPageDesigner_QuickStartGuide_Viewselector]
*3. View selector*

image::images/03-01-07-01-pp-designer-quick-start-guide/Payment_Page_Designer_view_selector.png[Payment Page Designer View Selector, width=520]

All of the designs you create with PPD are fully responsive: with the
view selector, you can switch between the web, tablet, and mobile
versions of your payment page/form.

[#PaymentPageDesigner_QuickStartGuide_RegistrationLogin]
====== Registration & Login

The login button can be found on the top right of the options menu.
