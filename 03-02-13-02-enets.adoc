[#PPv1_eNETS_Introduction]
====== Introduction

image::images/03-02-13-02-enets/logo_enets.png[eNETS logo, 200]

_eNETS_ is an online payment gateway hosted in Singapore, which provides consumers and businesses with a revolutionized way to shop and transact. _eNETS_ accepts direct debit in Singapore and all major credit cards and currencies. It does support 3D secure (Verified, MasterCard Secure Code and American Express Safekey) feature as well. eENTS has two variants which are _eNETS Credit_ and _eNETS Direct Debit_. 
//vhauss: we should remove the _eNets Credit_ as the PSPDOC says, WPP supports debit only.

_eNETS Direct Debit_ enables internet banking users to make payment in real-time manner from their bank accounts. Currently _eNETS Direct Debit_ is participated by DBS/POSB, OCBC, and UOB. Implementation can be done via API spelled out in Direct HTTPS and UMAPI.

//vhauss: we shouldn`t mention API integration here, as we describe WPPv1 integration.
