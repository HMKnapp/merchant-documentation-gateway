////
The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) is an initiative of the European banking
industry that makes electronic payments across the euro area as easy as domestic
payments within one country. The payments are processed under the same
basic conditions, rights, and obligations regardless of their location.

Guaranteed Direct Debit is a payment method which authorizes a transaction
before it transfers money from the consumer account to the merchant.

[#PPv2_GuaranteedDirectDebit_TransactionType_authorization]
====== Transaction Type _authorization_

An _authorization_ transaction performs a creditworthiness check at the moment
when the consumer makes an order. All order items must be listed for the shopping
basket. The authorization amount must match the value of the items in the basket.

For a successful _authorization_ transaction:

. Create an authorization session (initial authorization request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: parse and process the payment response.

//-

_Guaranteed Direct Debit_ payments.

.Initial Request

The initial request creates the payment session. If it's
successful, you receive a URL as a response which redirects to the
_Guaranteed Direct Debit_ payment form.
