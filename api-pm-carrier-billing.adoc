A mobile number is more than just a way to make a phone call. With Boku
(our payment provider for _carrier-billing_), a mobile number can be a
user identity, a digital address, and a payment method, all at the same
time. Boku's unique platform allows mobile operators and merchants
to rapidly design, scale, and operate programs aimed at giving mobile
subscribers a best-in-class experience for discovering, activating, and
purchasing new services. By providing access to a global network of
mobile operators and their subscribers, Boku offers merchants a powerful
channel with which to acquire and retain new users. These value
added services, in turn, deepen the commercial relationship mobile
operators have with their subscribers.

[#CarrierBilling_HowItWorks]
[discrete]
===== How it works

A full end-to-end program starts by promoting the merchant's service
across the various communication channels a mobile operator maintains
with its subscribers: web portals, mobile apps, retail stores, email
communications, SMS alerts, etc.

Once a subscriber signals interest in a promotion, their mobile number
can be used to activate and trial the service from any device.  If the
subscriber chooses to make a purchase or start a paid subscription, the
charges can be handled by their mobile operator through the same
mobile account used to purchase voice and data services. It is an
elegant, simple approach that starts and ends with the mobile number.

[#CarrierBilling_TransactionTypes_Debit]
===== _debit_ for _carrier-billing_

The payment method within the request must be _carrier-billing,_ the
transaction type _debit._ If the request is successful, the
_Forward-URL_ to the Landing-Page of the _carrier-billing_ provider will
be sent in the response. The notification allows a merchant to receive
the final status of a payment as soon as Wirecard receives it from the
_carrier-billing_ provider. Usually, this status is received within
seconds of the completion of the transaction, however, may take up to a
few days depending on the respective mobile provider.

Once Wirecard has received a notification from the _carrier-billing_
provider about the final status of the transaction, this status will be
communicated to the merchant via the <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN, Notification URL>> that is configured in the merchant account or provided with the
initial payment transaction request.

If no notification URL is provided with the request and also not
configured in the merchant account, the notification will be sent via
Email to the merchant in case the Email address has been configured. In
case merchant has not received the notification, the status of the
transaction can be requested by sending a <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_TransactionID, Retrieve Transaction by Transaction ID>> or
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_RequestID, Retrieve Transaction by Request ID>>.
