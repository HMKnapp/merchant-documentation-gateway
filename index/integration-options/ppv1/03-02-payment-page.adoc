- For a new payment page setup, we recommend to integrate <<WPP, _{payment-page-v2}_.>> 
- If you have already integrated _{payment-page-v1-abbr}_, you can rely on continued product support.

_{payment-page-v1}_ handles the payment method selection as
well as the collection of payment details or consumer redirects to
alternative payment provider sites. With this solution, the merchant
is only required to conform to a limited PCI scope (self-questionnaire
A).

_{payment-page-v1}_ is available in three formats:

- Hosted Payment Page (HPP)
- Embedded Payment Page (EPP)
- Seamless Integration
