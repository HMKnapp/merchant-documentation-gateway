=== From 3D Secure to 3D Secure 2
// === 3D Secure

3D Secure is a protocol supported by all major card schemes that
provides secure authentication and processing of online payments.
Merchants wishing to comply need to integrate the specific 3D requests
and payment parameters.

The Three Domain (3D) Secure initiative by VISA is a payment standard
for secure handling of credit card transactions in electronic commerce.
This provides issuers with the ability to authenticate cardholders
during an online purchase.

| Authentication is accomplished by verification of certain data which is
maintained by the card issuing bank and identifies the individual making
an online purchase as the legal owner of the card used. 3D Secure is
more than a payment authentication method or a technology definition. It
is a model to isolate the liabilities of the various parties involved in
the payment transaction cycle. The payment environment requires the
participating cardholder to be registered (enrolled) for the process
with his issuing bank. In essence, all parties involved in the payment
flow must support the 3D Secure transactions. The 3D framework
requires the card issuing and acquiring banks to provide cardholders and
merchants with an authentication methodology, without binding them to
proprietary technology.
