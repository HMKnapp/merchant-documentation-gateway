// | 3D Secure is a protocol supported by all major card schemes that
// provides secure authentication and processing of online payments. Authentication is accomplished by verification of certain data which is
// maintained by the card issuing bank and identifies the individual making
// an online purchase as the legal owner of the card used. 3D Secure is
// more than a payment authentication method or a technology definition. It
// is a model to isolate the liabilities of the various parties involved in
// the payment transaction cycle. The payment environment requires the
// participating cardholder to be registered (enrolled) for the process
// with their issuing bank. In essence, all parties involved in the payment
// flow must support the 3D Secure transactions. The 3D framework
// requires the card issuing and acquiring banks to provide cardholders and
// merchants with an authentication methodology, without binding them to
// proprietary technology.
