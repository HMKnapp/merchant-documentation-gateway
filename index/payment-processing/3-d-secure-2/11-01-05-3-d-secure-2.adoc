The https://www.emvco.com/about/overview/[EMVCo] have devised a new
standard authentication method for payment card transactions: *3D Secure 2 (3DS2).* 

This new protocol fulfills the Strong Customer
Authentication (SCA) requirements set by the <<CreditCard_PSD2, EU's Second Payment Service Directive>> for online payments within the
European Economic Area (EEA).

*3D Secure 2 is now available* and set to become the prime
authentication method for online card payments, thanks to a number of
updates that improve not only the security, but also the consumer
experience of <<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_3DSecure, 3D Secure 1 (3DS)>>.

[#CreditCard_3DS2_Why]
[discrete]
=== Why Adopt 3D Secure 2?

When 3D Secure 1 was first introduced in 2001, it provided a
state-of-the-art fraud prevention system. But the face of e-commerce has
changed drastically in the past years. Mobile and in-app payment is
booming, a seamless shopping experience more important than ever, and
the demands on security growing. The 3D Secure 2 protocol has been
designed for this brave new world and offers the flexibility needed to
adapt to an ever-changing e-commerce landscape.

[#CreditCard_3DS2_Advantages]

=== 3D Secure 2 - The Advantages

[cols="30,70"]
|===
| *No more static passwords*
| The days of rummaging through your drawers to find your 3DS password are over. Consumers will no longer have to look for their passwords and are more likely to complete their purchases.
| *Two-factor authentication*
| 3DS2 implements two-factor authentication.
//<<CreditCard_PSD2, two-factor-authentication>>, as required by PSD2. 
To make the experience more convenient for consumers, authentication can be completed, for example, with a token and a simple thumbprint.
| *Fewer false declines*
| The new protocol provides ten times more information to the issuers, which helps drastically reduce the number of false declines. Consumers will retain their trust in 3DS2-secured transactions.
| *Mobile-enabled security*
| Consumers will no longer be redirected to potentially non-mobile-ready authorization pages.
| *Less cart abandonment*
| Overall greater convenience, a faster checkout process, and a seamless shopping experience will reduce shopping cart abandonment by 70%.
| *Merchant opt-out*
| As a merchant, if you decide for 3DS2, you regain the freedom to choose which transactions you send through the protocol and which ones you don't. However, please keep in mind that issuers may have to decline the transaction because SCA is required on their side.
|===

As with 3DS1, 3D Secure 2 also protects the merchant from liability in
cases of fraud.
