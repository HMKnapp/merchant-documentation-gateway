The https://www.emvco.com/about/overview/[EMVCo] have devised a new
standard authentication method for payment card transactions: *3D Secure 2 (3DS2).* 

This new protocol fulfills the Strong Customer
Authentication (SCA) requirements set by the <<CreditCard_PSD2, EU's Second Payment Service Directive>> for online payments within the
European Economic Area (EEA).

*3D Secure 2 is now available* and set to become the prime
authentication method for online card payments, thanks to a number of
updates that improve not only the security, but also the consumer
experience of <<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_3DSecure, 3D Secure 1 (3DS)>>.

[discrete]
=== Why Adopt 3D Secure 2?

When 3D Secure 1 was first introduced in 2001, it provided a
state-of-the-art fraud prevention system. But the face of e-commerce has
changed drastically in the past years. Mobile and in-app payment is
booming, a seamless shopping experience more important than ever, and
the demands on security growing. The 3D Secure 2 protocol has been
designed for this brave new world and offers the flexibility needed to
adapt to an ever-changing e-commerce landscape.
