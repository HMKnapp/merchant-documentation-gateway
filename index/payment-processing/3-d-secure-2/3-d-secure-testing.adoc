[#3DS2_Testing_TestCards]
=== Test Cards

In this section you can find _3D Secure_ test cards for a variety of card brands. These test cards allow you to trigger a certain behaviour when you send them to our endpoint. We provide test cards for both versions, _3D Secure 1_ and _3D Secure 2._

.Example
If you want to provoke the error status code ``500.1072`` ("_Card Not Enrolled_.")
in combination with a Visa card for a _3D Secure_ transaction, use
_Card Number_ ``4012000300006002``, _Expiration Date_ ``{cc-exp-month}/{cc-exp-year}`` and _CVC_ ``002``.

[#3DS2_Testing_TestCards_3DSecure1]
==== 3D Secure 1 Transactions

When you do a <<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_3DSecure, _3D Secure_ transaction>>,
{payment-gateway-abbr} checks with the first request, whether the card is enrolled in _3D Secure_.
A transaction is _3D Secure_, if the response returns a positive enrollment
check and a positive authentication result.

[#3DS2_Testing_TestCards_3DSecure1_success]
.Card Numbers for Successful Transactions

With these card numbers you can provoke a successful response containing the
status code ``201.0000`` ("The resource was successfully created.").
