== General Multi-Party Commerce

In general multi-party commerce, a consumer buys a product or service from a merchant. At the time of purchase, the consumer acquires an additional product or service provided by a different merchant. This merchant charges for the additional product or service. +
For example, a consumer purchases a washing machine (from the primary merchant) and a breakdown and repair insurance (from the secondary merchant).
