Strong Customer Authentication is a security measure that relies on
two-factor authentication to verify the identity of the consumer in a
payment transaction. As a result, these factors are strictly
consumer-based. SCA can combine two of the following three factors,
which must be strictly independent of each other:

| *Knowledge*
| *Possession*
| *Inherence*

| This factor relies on the consumer's unique knowledge of a password or a
PIN. Knowledge must not be easily accessible by unauthorized parties.
The https://eba.europa.eu/about-us[European Banking Authority (EBA)] has determined that credit card number, CVV and
expiry date are not valid knowledge, as these are printed on the credit
card.

| This factor relies on the consumer's possession to verify a payment.
For example, hardware, such as smartphones and tablets registered to the
consumer, can be used as a second verification instance.

| This factor uses biometrics to verify the consumer's identity, for
example, a fingerprint or a facial scan.

[WARNING]
====
For all payments authenticated with Strong Customer Authentication, as
well as <<CreditCard_3DS2_Exemption_Adviser, those exempted from SCA>>, the payment service provider must ensure that the fraud rates for online payments are the same as, or lower than the <<CreditCard_PSD2_Fraud, EU reference fraud rate>> set out in the PSD 2.
