== What is PSD 2? 

//.The Second Payment Service Directive (PSD 2) in a Nutshell

- *New Regulation:* EU's Second Payment Service Directive (PSD 2) for
online payments within the European Economic Area (EEA)
- *Requires:* Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)
- *What it is:* A measure to combat fraud in card-not-present
transactions
- *Who is affected:* Issuers, acquirers, and merchants in the EEA

//-

//The EU's Second **P**ayment **S**ervice **D**irective (PSD 2) aims to reduce
//fraud in the European e-commerce sector. Since the largest percentage of
//all card fraud in Europe happens in card-not-present transactions, the
//PSD 2 makes **S**trong **C**ustomer **A**uthentication (SCA) mandatory
//for *consumer-initiated online payments* within the **E**uropean
//**E**conomic **A**rea (EEA).

//While the regulations defined in _PSD 2_ apply to acquirers and issuers,
//the effects will also concern EEA merchants and consumers.

// To get you ready for SCA, the https://www.emvco.com/about/overview/[EMVCo] have developed <<CreditCard_3DS2, 3D Secure 2>>, a new authentication protocol for payment card transactions.

=== What is Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)?

Strong Customer Authentication is a security measure that relies on
two-factor authentication to verify the identity of the consumer in a
payment transaction. As a result, these factors are strictly
consumer-based. SCA can combine two of the following three factors,
which must be strictly independent of each other:

| *Knowledge*
| *Possession*
| *Inherence*

| This factor relies on the consumer's unique knowledge of a password or a
PIN. Knowledge must not be easily accessible by unauthorized parties.
The https://eba.europa.eu/about-us[European Banking Authority (EBA)] has determined that credit card number, CVV and
expiry date are not valid knowledge, as these are printed on the credit
card.

| This factor relies on the consumer's possession to verify a payment.
For example, hardware, such as smartphones and tablets registered to the
consumer, can be used as a second verification instance.

| This factor uses biometrics to verify the consumer's identity, for
example, a fingerprint or a facial scan.

For all payments authenticated with Strong Customer Authentication, as
well as those exempted from SCA, the payment service provider must
ensure that the fraud rates for online payments are the same as, or
lower than the EU reference fraud rate set out in the PSD 2:
