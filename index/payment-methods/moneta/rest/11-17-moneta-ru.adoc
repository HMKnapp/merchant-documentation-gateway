_moneta.ru_ is a well-established and widely used payment method and
electronic wallet in Russia and the Ukraine. After registering and
opening an account, funds may be transferred to and from this account.
The account holder may load funds to the account using both credit and
debit cards as well as alternative payment methods, such as Yandex.Money
and Web Money.
--

To make a payment using a moneta.ru account, consumers log in to their
account and authorize the transaction. Once the payment is authorized by
the consumer, the payment may no longer be cancelled. This ensures a
payment guarantee and allows the merchant to deliver the goods or
provide services immediately upon receipt of the payment. Any
discrepancies that might appear are settled directly between the
consumer and _moneta.ru._

_moneta.ru_ processes payments for many renowned gaming companies making
the online gaming industry one of _moneta.ru_'s core businesses for
payouts.
