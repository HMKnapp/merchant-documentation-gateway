[#FraudPrevention_AVS_ValueResponse]
=== AVS Values and Responses

Each card scheme maintain an own set of return codes. To facilitate the
implementation Wirecard maps those codes to a uniformed set of scheme
independent response codes.

[#FraudPrevention_AVS_PaymentResponse]
==== AVS in Payment Response

If merchant's Wirecard provider account is configured to store AVS data
(``connector.avs.data.store=true``) the AVS result is returned as additional
part in the payment response and notification.

[#FraudPrevention_AVS_WirecardResponseCodes]
==== Wirecard Response Codes

The following table outlines the set of codes used by Wirecard. This
uniformed codes should be the preferred source for decisions related to AVS.

[#FraudPrevention_AVS_AuthorizationEntity]
==== Authorization Entity

The Authorization Entity defines the party responding to the AVS Request.

[cols="4,13"]

| Authorization Entity | Message

| 2                    | Response provided by Intermediate processor.

[#FraudPrevention_AVS_ProviderResponseCode]
==== Provider Response Code

The Provider Response Code is the code returned from the provider. If
the business case was activated for AVS the code it is returned together
in the response, together with the human readable Provider Response
Message. The following table lists the current set of codes used by the
card schemes and outlines the mapping between the Provider Response Code
and the unified Wirecard Response Code. Please note that the actual
Provider Response Code depends on the actual used provider and could be
also changed and extended by the provider.
So it may differ from the table below. Therefore Wirecard recommends the
preferred usage of the Wirecard Response Code.
