[#API_CreditCard_Fields_card]
====== *card*

<``card``> is a subcategory of <<API_CreditCard_Fields_payment,``<payment>``>> and is only sent in the first transaction
request when the card is used for the first time. Due to PCI DSS compliance
these data is transferred to a token immediately. Beginning with the first
response, <``card``> is replaced by a token. With this first response, this token
is used for every transaction (request and response) that is performed with
this credit card. Token data is provided in the fields <<API_CreditCard_Fields_cardtoken,``<card-token>``>>.

NOTE: ONLY the transaction type detokenize returns <``expiration-month``>,
<``expiration-year``> and <``card-type``> in a response. All the other
transaction types return elements of
<<API_CreditCard_Fields_cardtoken,``<card-token>``>> in response.
