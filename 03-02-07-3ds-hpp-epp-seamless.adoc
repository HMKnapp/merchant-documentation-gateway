[#PP_3DSecure]
==== 3D Secure

3D Secure payment can be processed via all the three Payment Page
integrations: HPP, EPP or Seamless. The main benefit is a simple credit
card payment request. The payment page automatically performs all
necessary steps to check 3D enrollment of the card, redirects to the
cardholder's bank and processes a response.

*3D Secure 2 is now also available* and set to become the prime
authentication method for online card payments, thanks to a number of
updates that improve not only the security, but also the consumer
experience of 3D Secure 1 (3DS).

The workflow remains the same but <<PP_3DSecure_2_Fields, *3D Secure 2 requires additional fields*>>.

[#PP_3DSecure_Preconditions]
===== Preconditions

In order to process card payments with a 3D Secure verification,
following *two preconditions* must be met:

.. The initial payment request needs to contain ``attempt_three_d`` attribute set to
``true``.

| Field            | Required | Datatype | Value      | Description

| attempt_three_d  | Optional | Boolean  | true/false | Indicates that the Transaction Request should proceed with the 3D Secure workflow if the
                                                   [Card Holder] is enrolled. Otherwise, the transaction proceeds without 3D Secure.

[#PP_3DSecure_2_Fields]
===== 3D Secure 2 - Additional Request Fields

To create a payment session with *Credit Card using 3D Secure 2 authentication*, you need to *include additional 3D Secure 2 fields in your initial request.*

Most of these fields are optional but we recommend the implementation of
optional fields, as this creates a smoother user experience and ensures
a higher level of security.

Need more information on 3D Secure 2? Head to our <<CreditCard_3DS2, general introduction to 3D Secure 2>>.

[#PP_3DSecure_Workflow]
===== The 3D Secure Workflow of the Payment Page

The workflow of 3D secure behaves almost identical for HPP, EPP and
Seamless.

Two differences can be observed. One after a successful check of a card
enrollment and another one after a successful authentication check.

See workflow graphic for details.
