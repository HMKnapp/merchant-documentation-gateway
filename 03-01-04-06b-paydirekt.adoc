====== About _paydirekt_

image::images/03-01-04-06b-paydirekt/paydirekt-logo.png[paydirekt logo, 200]

_paydirekt_ is a payment method offered by Germany’s private banks and
local cooperative banks. The online payment system is an initiative of
several major banks in Germany. _paydirekt_ is integrated into the
systems of the participating banks and follows the strict requirements
from the German banking industry. A major benefit for the merchants is
that the payment solution is made in Germany. Consumers may be more
receptive towards a local payment method rather than a foreign player.
It offers an immediate payment guarantee, a simple interface, easy
connection via payment service providers and standard plugins as well as
a high transaction security, age verification, and consumer
authentication.
