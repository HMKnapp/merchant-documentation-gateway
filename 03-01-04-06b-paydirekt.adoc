[#PPv2_paydirekt_About]
====== About _paydirekt_

image::images/03-01-04-06b-paydirekt/paydirekt-logo.png[paydirekt logo, 200]

_paydirekt_ is a payment method offered by Germany’s private banks and
local cooperative banks. The online payment system is an initiative of
several major banks in Germany. _paydirekt_ is integrated into the
systems of the participating banks and follows the strict requirements
from the German banking industry. A major benefit for the merchants is
that the payment solution is made in Germany. Consumers may be more
receptive towards a local payment method rather than a foreign player.
It offers an immediate payment guarantee, a simple interface, easy
connection via payment service providers and standard plugins as well as
a high transaction security, age verification, and consumer
authentication.

[#PPv2_paydirekt_TransactionTypes]
===== Transaction Types

With _paydirect_ you can send <<PPv2_paydirekt_TransactionType_authorization, _authorization_>>, <<PPv2_paydirekt_TransactionType_debit, _debit_>> and <<PPv2_paydirekt_TransactionTypes_capturerefund, _capture-authorization_>>.

[#PPv2_paydirekt_TransactionType_authorization]
====== Transaction Type _authorization_

An _authorization_ transaction reserves funds from the cardholder’s account. Typically, the limit ranges from three to thirty days to conduct a follow up transaction (e.g. _capture-authorization_), depending on the acquirer.

////

The description of transaction types is also a good example for an "include" file. We must find a description that fits all the APMs and save it in the "include" folder.
Then we can refer to it from every APM.

////

For a successful _authorization_ transaction:

<<paydirekt, _paydirekt_ specification>>.

[#PPv2_paydirekt_TransactionTypes_capturerefund]
====== Transaction Types _capture-authorization_, _refund-debit_ and _refund-capture_

Basically, _paydirekt_ with {payment-page-abbr} supports _authorization_ and _debit_ only. You can integrate post process operations for _paydirekt_ via our <<REST API, paydirekt_TransactionTypes>>.

You must provide the necessary data:

``parent-transaction-id``: This is the ``transaction-id`` of the transaction (e.g. _authorization_) you want to refer to. You find it in a successful (e.g. _authorization_) response.

``requested-amount`` (can be either the total amount for refunding the full amount, or a partial amount for a partial refund).
