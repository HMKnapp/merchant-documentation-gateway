[#PPv2_paydirekt_About]
====== About _paydirekt_

image::images/03-01-04-06b-paydirekt/paydirekt-logo.png[paydirekt logo, 200]

_paydirekt_ is a payment method offered by Germany’s private banks and
local cooperative banks. The online payment system is an initiative of
several major banks in Germany. _paydirekt_ is integrated into the
systems of the participating banks and follows the strict requirements
from the German banking industry. A major benefit for the merchants is
that the payment solution is made in Germany. Consumers may be more
receptive towards a local payment method rather than a foreign player.
It offers an immediate payment guarantee, a simple interface, easy
connection via payment service providers and standard plugins as well as
a high transaction security, age verification, and consumer
authentication.

[#PPv2_paydirekt_TransactionType_debit]
====== Transaction Type _debit_

A _debit_ transaction charges the specified amount from the account
holder's bank account and marks it for immediate transfer.

For a successful _debit_ transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You
find them below.

<<PPv2_paydirekt_TestCredentials, Endpoint>> for _paydirekt_ transactions.

.Initial Request

The initial request creates the payment session. If it is
successful, you receive a URL as a response which redirects to the payment form.

.Request Headers

| Content-Type  | application/json

.Optional fields

For a full list of optional fields you can use, see the REST API

[cols="15e,10,10,10,5,50"]
|===
2+| Field (JSON) | Data Type | Required/Optional | Size | Description

| merchant-account-id e| value | String | Required | 36 | A unique identifier assigned to every merchant account (by Wirecard).
2+| request-id                | String | Required | 64 | A unique identifier assigned to every request (by merchant). Used when
searching for or referencing it later. ``{{$guid}}`` serves as a
placeholder for a random ``request-id``.

Allowed characters:  [a-z0-9-_]
2+| transaction-type          | String | Required | 36 | The requested transaction type. For _paydirekt_ payments, the
transaction-type must be set to ``debit``.
.2+| requested-amount e| value | Numeric | Required | 18 | The full amount that is requested/contested in a transaction. 2 decimal
places allowed.

Use . (decimal point) as the separator.

                       | currency | String | Required | 3 | The currency of the requested/contested transaction amount. For _paydirekt_
                         payments, the currency must be set to ``EUR``.

Format: 3-character abbreviation according to ISO 4217.
| payment-method      e| name     | String | Required | 15 | The name of the payment method used. Set this value to ``paydirekt``.
2+| descriptor                   | String | Required | 27 | Description of the transaction for account holder's bank statement

2+| fail-redirect-url            | String | Required | 2000 a| The URL to which the consumer is redirected after a failed payment,
e.g. ``\https://demoshop-test.wirecard.com/demoshop/#/error``
2+| cancel-redirect-url          | String | Required | 2000 a| The URL to which the consumer is redirected after having canceled a payment,
e.g. ``\https://demoshop-test.wirecard.com/demoshop/#/cancel``

.2. Redirect the Consumer to the Payment Page (Initial Response URL)

[source,json]
----
{

}
----


[cols="15e,10,75"]
|===
| Field (JSON) | Data Type | Description

| payment-redirect-url | String | The URL which redirects to the payment
form. Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===


At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<PPv2, integration method>>﻿).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled. The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as _failed_, but the
``status description`` indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64-encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>>﻿﻿
for more details on redirection targets after payment and transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.

[#PPv2_paydirekt_PostProcessing]
====== Post-Processing Operations 

{payment-page-v2-abbr} is best used to deal with one-off payments (e.g. regular,
independent _debit_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of
them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions).
However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of
post-processing operation — such as a refund of one of your _debit_ transactions 
— use our <<RestApi, REST API>>﻿﻿ directly.

WARNING: A direct refund through {payment-page-v2-abbr} is not possible for _paydirekt_ so you have to
obtain your consumer's banking information and send the refund using
_SEPA Credit Transfer_. +
Check the REST API <<SEPACreditTransfer, _SEPA Credit Transfer_ specification>> for details on
_paydirekt_ specific post-processing operations.
