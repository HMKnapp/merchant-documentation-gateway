[#PPv2_GuaranteedInvoice_TransactionType_authorization]
====== Transaction Type _authorization_

An _authorization_

- performs a creditworthiness check at the moment when the consumer makes an order.
- does not trigger money transfer.

//-

[NOTE]
====
. <<PPv2_GuaranteedInvoice_TransactionType_authorization_orderItem, All Shopping basket items (order-items)>>  must be specified in every request.
. The authorization amount must match the total value of the items in the basket.
. The response for each ``authorization`` request returns the field ``descriptor``, a unique alphanumerical code identifying the authorization. This ``descriptor`` must be printed on all invoice documents and saved by
the shop (used by consumers in bank transfers; German:
"Verwendungszweck"). 
. You have to <<PPv2_GuaranteedInvoice_PostProcessingOperations, capture>> each succesful authorization on the same day the goods are dispatched.
. The period between the ``authorization`` and the capture must be at least 4 hours.

====

For a successful _authorization_ transaction

. Create an _authorization_ session (initial _authorization_ request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

[#PPv2_GuaranteedInvoice_PostProcessingOperations]
====== Post-Processing Operations 
WPP is best used for one-off payments (e.g. regular, independent _authorization_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions). However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of post-processing operation - such as a capturing of one of your _authorization_ transactions - use our <<RestApi, REST API>> directly.

NOTE: Check the REST API <<link to the respective REST API page if available, {payment-method-name} specification>> for details on {payment-method-name}-specific post-processing operations.

To complete a purchase, i.e. to capture an authorization, you must provide the necessary data:

- ``parent-transaction-id``: This is the transaction ID of the preceding
authorization. You can retrieve it from the response to a successful authorization.
- ``amount``: This can be either the total amount for capturing the full
amount, or a partial amount for a partial capture.
